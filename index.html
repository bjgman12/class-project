               <p>Each round all players are given 5 gold with which they can do a couple of things.
                   buy units to put into battle, spend for experience to level up, or reroll the RNG draw
                   of units to choose from. For every increment for 10 gold you hold at the end of each round 
                   you generate 1+ unit of gold up to 5 maxing your interest at 50 gold. Gold bonuses are also 
                   earned for both Win and Loss streaks. Once you learn to manage your income effectively you will 
                   see your success rate sky rocket.

               <p>In TFT each unit has several traits associated with it, when a designated amount of these
                   units with matching traits are on your board they activate what are called synergies giving your 
                   team specific buffs associated with that synergy.By mixing and matchign these you can create unique and powerful
                  team compisitions.

               <p>Once you have godl management mastered and have a solid understanding of synergies the next
                   step in being a competitive TFT battler is placement. The board is set in a hexagonal grid type fashion
                   half being for your units and half being for your opponent. how you place your units on the board can be the difference
                   between winning and losing  positioning your unit both so your important damage dealers are protected and your opponents 
                   are targeted with priority
